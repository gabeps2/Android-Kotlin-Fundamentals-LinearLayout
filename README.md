# Summary

* A ViewGroup is a view that can contain other views. LinearLayout and ScrollView are view groups.

* LinearLayout is a view group that arranges its child views horizontally or vertically.

* Use a ScrollView when you need to display content on the screen, such as long text or a collection of images. A scroll view can contain only one child view. If you want to scroll more than one view, then add a ViewGroup such as a LinearLayout to the ScrollView, and put the views to be scrolled inside that ViewGroup.

* The Layout Editor is a visual design editor inside Android Studio. You can use the Layout Editor to build your app's layout by dragging UI elements into the layout.

* A style is a collection of attributes that specify the appearance for a view. For example, a style can specify font color, font size, background color, padding, and margin.

* You can extract and collect all the formatting of a view into a style. To give your app a consistent look, reuse the style for other views.
